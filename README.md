# Unity Tips, Tricks and Best Practices
Tips, tricks and best practices for working with Unity.

## Process
**Avoid branching assets**. There should always only ever be one version of any asset. If you absolutely have to branch a prefab, scene, or mesh, follow a process that makes it very clear which is the right version. The "wrong" branch should have a funky name, for example, use a double underscore prefix: `__MainScene_Backup`.

**Each team member should have a second copy of the project checked out for testing** if you are using version control. After changes, this second copy, the clean copy, should be updated and tested. No-one should make any changes to their clean copies. This is especially useful to catch missing assets.

## Scene Organization



## Optimization
* Use object pool

## Editor Setting
* `Edit > Project Settings > Editor`
    * `Asset Serialization` > `Force Text`
